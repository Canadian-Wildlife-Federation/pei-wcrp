    "text": "Homepage\nThe following Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) represents the culmination of a collaborative planning effort with the Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF), The Atlantic Salmon Federation (ASF), and the Souris and Area Branch of the PEI Wildlife Federation (SAB). The overall aim is to build meaningful partnerships, aid in reducing the threat of aquatic barriers to diadromous fish, and all that they represent, as well as the livelihoods that they support. This plan will identify priority actions that the SAB WCRP partners propose to undertake between 2023-2033 to preserve and restore fish connectivity in the seven northeastern salmon watershed systems of North Lake Creek, Priest Pond Creek, Cross River, Hay River, Bear River, Naufrage River, and Cow River. This will be done through barrier rehabilitation and prevention strategies. These strategies will be shared with local First Nations, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), the PEI Government, NGOs, and local stakeholders to inform directed efforts to improve fish productivity and diversity in these watersheds.",

    "section": "Project Scope",
    "text": "Project Scope\nConnectivity is a critical component of freshwater ecosystems that encompasses a variety of factors related to ecosystem structure and function, such as the ability of aquatic species to disperse and/or migrate, the transportation of energy and matter (e.g., nutrient cycling and sediment flows), and temperature regulation (Seliger and Zeiringer (2018)). Though each of these factors are important when considering the health of a watershed, for the purposes of this WCRP the term “connectivity” is defined as the degree to which aquatic species can disperse or migrate freely through freshwater systems. Within this context, connectivity is primarily constrained by physical barriers, including human-made infrastructure such as dams and stream crossings, and natural features such as waterfalls, barrier beaches, and beaver dams. This plan will focus on the direct rehabilitation and prevention of localized, physical barriers instead of the broad, land-use patterns causing chronic connectivity issues in the watershed. The planning team decided that the primary focus of this WCRP is addressing barriers to longitudinal connectivity (i.e., along the upstream-downstream plane) due to the importance of maintaining fish passage to spawning and rearing habitat in the watershed.\nThe geographic scope of this WCRP is seven watersheds (North Lake Creek, Priest Pond Creek, Cross River, Hay River, Bear River, Naufrage River and Cow River) in Souris, PEI, (Figure 1). The seven watersheds have a total drainage area of 205.46 km2 (with 257 linear km of streams and rivers) ranging from 2.5 km2 in Priest Pond Creek to ~49 km2 in North Lake Creek, spanning as far west as Selkirk and as east as North Lake and draining into the ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The primary geographic scope, the northeastern cluster of seven Atlantic salmon watersheds — North Lake Creek, Priest Pond Creek, Cross River, Hay River, Bear River, Naufrage River, Cow River— located in Souris, Prince Edward Island.",

    "title": "Project Overview",
    "section": "Focal species",
    "text": "Focal species\nFocal species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being directly conserved or restored in the watershed. The planning team selected three focal species: Atlantic Salmon, American Eel, and Rainbow Smelt. While Brook Trout were initially discussed as a potential focal species, they were not specifically included in this iteration of the connectivity plan given that addressing barriers to Atlantic Salmon would indirectly benefit Brook Trout populations that are seemingly abundant across the seven watersheds. The selection of these focal species was driven primarily by local conservation goals.\n\nAtlantic Salmon | Salmo salar\nAtlantic Salmon are anadromous fishes, meaning mature adults spawn in freshwater and juveniles rear in freshwater before undergoing a process called smoltification where they migrate out to the ocean for 1-3+ years before returning to the freshwater to repeat this process. Due to this migratory process, salmon require unimpeded access between the ocean and freshwater habitats to complete their life cycle.\nAtlantic Salmon spawn in the pool-riffle transition zones of the main stem and larger tributaries of a river (De Gaudemar, Bonzom, and Beall (2000); Finstad, Armstrong, and Nislow (2010)). Within these stretches, they seek out the tails of pools, where substrate size allows for females to excavate a space to deposit the eggs to incubate below gravel beds. Fast flowing, well oxygenated water with minimal fine sediments helps to maximize successful embryo development. Atlantic Salmon juveniles (fry and parr) rear in habitat that is deeper and slower, to facilitate their weaker swimming and predation capabilities. Water depth, velocity, and substrate size tend to increase with parr as they increase in size and age. Shelter, in the form of large rocks, boulders, or overhead cover provide crucial refuge for overwintering habitat. Channel gradients most typically associated with these preferred spawning and rearing habitats range from 0.12 to 25%; with highest concentrations below 3% (Amiro (1993)).\nAtlantic Salmon spawn in all seven of these watersheds in northeastern PEI, with North Lake Creek, Cross River, and Naufrage River supporting the highest productivity. Returns have declined in Priest Pond Creek, Hay River, Bear River, and Cow River over the past four to five years. Salmon in this region are within the proposed Gaspe-Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence designable unit, and were assessed by Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) as Special Concern in 2010 (COSEWIC (2010)). See (Appendix B) for maps of modelled salmon habitat in the seven watersheds.\n\n\nAmerican Eel | Anguilla rostrata\nAmerican Eel are catadromous species, meaning they spawn in the Sargasso Sea and drift with the ocean currents towards the continental shelf as glass eels. Elvers then continue migrating towards freshwater tributaries to feed and mature, although some populations have been known to stay in the estuaries and bays or move between freshwater and estuary habitat over their life cycle. Their ability to tolerate a wide variety of salinities and temperature thresholds allows them to occupy a variety of habitat types. See (Appendix B) for maps of modelled eel habitat in the seven watersheds.\nAmerican Eel are widely distributed throughout the seven PEI watersheds and occupy freshwater habitat and estuary habitat for feeding (on small fish, mollusks, insects, and crustaceans) and growth. SAB did a burrowing survey in 2018 to confirm both salt water and freshwater abodes for American eel. Notable habitat sites for eels in our management area include North Lake Creek and Naufrage River. They are found in almost all the seven salmon rivers in northeastern PEI, but populations are the largest and healthiest in North Lake Creek and Naufrage River. It is known that eels are non-specific in what habitat they prefer while on Prince Edward Island, but impediments like perched or hanging culverts can hinder passage to areas where food sources may be best to allow them to suitably develop and grow. The bigger they become the best chance they have of reaching sexual maturity and in turn can migrate to achieve species proliferation. American Eel were assessed as Threatened by COSEWIC in 2012 (COSEWIC (2012)).\n\n\nRainbow Smelt | Osmerus mordax\nRainbow Smelt in PEI are anadromous, meaning they migrate from the ocean to freshwater habitats where they spawn following the spring freshet. Spawning generally takes place in lower elevations of rivers and streams. Rainbow smelt requires substrate such as silt, gravel and rock, and aquatic vegetation and wood debris to deposit their eggs during spawning. See (Appendix B) for maps of modelled smelt habitat in the seven watersheds.\nSmelts are a popular food fish for many Islanders and support a commercial and recreational fishery. The smelt dip net fishery runs from April 1st to June 15th and the angling season is open from April 15th to September 15th. Not a lot is known about smelt runs, except for local traditional fishing knowledge regarding times for fishing and areas for fishing smelts.They do tend to be moving when Atlantic Salmon smolts are making their migration towards the ocean from upstream habitat areas, in mid-May to mid-June.",

    "text": "Geographic Scope\nThe geographic scope of this WCRP was further refined by identifying “naturally accessible” waterbodies, which are defined as streams, lakes, or reservoirs that focal species should be able to access in the absence of human-made barriers. Naturally accessible waterbodies were spatially delineated for each species using stream characteristics that define the upper limit of their movement based on their swimming abilities (Table 1). Areas of high, sustained beaver activity that has led to long-term changes in the habitat conditions were excluded from the salmon model due to the unfavorable conditions for barrier rehabilitation. The spatial extent of the naturally accessible waterbodies layer was then refined based on existing fish observation data or redd surveys (for Atlantic Salmon). These maps were explored by the planning team to incorporate additional local knowledge, ensure accuracy, and finalize the criteria used to define naturally accessible waterbodies, which are shown for Atlantic Salmon (Figure 2) and Rainbow Smelt (Figure 3). An equivalent map was not provided for American Eel because all stream segments (Figure 1) were considered naturally accessible for this species. The new geographic scope formed the foundation for all subsequent analyses and planning steps, including mapping and modelling key habitat, quantifying the current connectivity status, goal setting, and action planning (Mazany-Wright et al. (2021)).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Species-specific stream characteristics used to spatially delineate naturally accessible waterbodies for Atlantic Salmon, American Eel, and Rainbow Smelt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nAccessiblity Parameters\n\n\n\n\nAtlantic Salmon \nChannel gradient &lt;30%; waterfalls &lt;5m \n\n\nAmerican Eel \nAll stream segments \n\n\nRainbow Smelt \nChannel gradient &lt;5%; all waterfalls  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Naturally accessible waterbodies (&lt;30% channel gradient and &lt;5m waterfalls) to Atlantic Salmon within the seven watersheds of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Naturally accessible waterbodies (&lt;5% channel gradient and below any waterfall) to Rainbow Smelt within the seven watersheds of interest.",

    "section": "Structure Types",
    "text": "Structure Types\nTable 2 highlights structure types that pose the greatest threat to Atlantic Salmon, American Eel, and Rainbow Smelt in the seven watersheds. Each structure was assessed for its extent (proportion of the focal species’ total habitat amount that is disconnected by all barriers of a given barrier type) and severity (proportion of barrier occurrences that restrict passage to the focal species). Then, the extent and severity scores were combined in a matrix to identify an overall threat rating. Proportions were either scored as low (1-10%), medium (11-30%), high (31-70%), or very high (71-100%) (Table 2). Ultimately, structure types that affect a large amount of habitat and frequently block fish passage (fully or partially) received the highest ratings. No structures were given a rating of very high. The results of this assessment exercise were used to inform the subsequent planning steps, as well as to identify knowledge gaps where there is little spatial data to inform the assessment for a specific structure type.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: The overall threat rating (based on the combined extent and severity) of five barrier types on the three focal species, Atlantic Salmon, American Eel, and Rainbow Smelt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure Types\nAtlantic Salmon\nAmerican Eel\nRainbow Smelt\n\n\n\n\nBlowdowns/blockages\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\n\n\nBarrier Beaches\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\n\n\nStream Crossings\nMedium\nMedium\nMedium\n\n\nDams\nMedium\nMedium\nHigh\n\n\nBeaver Activity\nMedium\nLow\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlowdowns/Blockages\nIn September 2022, Hurricane Fiona caused severe damage to forested areas, leading to a level of fallen trees that has been estimated to be as large as 8-10 years’ worth of PEI’s logging sector harvests. These blowdowns caused physical blockages in the river systems throughout all seven watersheds and required substantial removal efforts. Although these areas are not mapped spatially and incorporated into the estimated connectivity status, clearing blockages was a significant restoration effort undertaken by SAB for the past two years to restore connectivity and fish habitat in these seven watersheds.\n\n\nBarrier Beaches\nThere are five barrier beaches at the mouths of Priest Pond Creek, Cross River, Hay River, Bear River, and Cow River. These beaches serve as important estuary habitats where anadromous fish return to, or exit from, during a portion of their life cycle. The stability of barrier beaches, and therefore, passability for anadromous species, can depend on factors such as excessive or diminished sediment supply, rising sea levels resulting in washouts, and high rates of landward migration or fragmentation (Forbes et al. (1990)). Additionally, human-made modifications of these systems (e.g., rock piles and culverts/fish ladders) enable further widening and shortening of the estuary, the creation of upstream reservoirs, and homogenization of stream characteristics, making these systems more susceptible to instability and blocking fish passage. Priest Pond Creek, Cross River, and Cow River beach accesses are considered passable, whereas Bear River is considered a partial barrier due to its over widened, shallow channel. At Hay River barrier beach there is a degraded culvert with a fish ladder attached to it, and this set of structures range from partial barrier for Atlantic Salmon and American Eel to a full barrier for Rainbow Smelt.\n\n\nDams\nThere are four mapped dams on naturally accessible waterbodies, three of which are blocking modelled key habitat for American Eel (24.5 km) and Atlantic Salmon (40.8 km). No modelled Rainbow Smelt habitat is located upstream of these dams. Dams impede passage for all three focal species. Dams would have the largest impact on Rainbow Smelt due to their poor jumping abilities as smaller-bodied fish; however, there are no dams downstream of Rainbow Smelt habitat in this area. There are two known fish-passage structures associated with dams in the seven watersheds: a Denil fish ladder on Larkins Dam in the Naufrage River watershed and a natural bypass channel at Millers Dam that leads to a culvert downstream in the North Lake Creek watershed system. Larkins Dam was identified on the priority barrier list (?tbl-priority).\n\n\nStream Crossings\nRoad-stream crossings are the most abundant structure type, with 181 stream crossings located downstream of modelled key habitat for either Atlantic Salmon, American Eel, or Rainbow Smelt. Stream crossings fully or partially block 35.2 km (52% of habitat upstream of stream crossings) for smelt, 93.1 km (33%) for salmon and 103.9 km (61%) for eel. Seven stream crossings (all closed bottom culverts) have been confirmed as barriers to fish passage.\n\n\nBeaver Activity\nThe planning team recognizes that sustained beaver activity can impact the habitat and movement of the three focal species. However, beaver activity across these seven watersheds is transient, and ongoing management of its impacts is being carried out throughout the field season. This means that modelling the set location of the activity on the landscape can be challenging and may not be as effective in understanding habitat connectivity for Atlantic Salmon, American Eel, and Rainbow Smelt. Therefore, the planning team chose not to include beaver activity as a stationary, physical barrier in the connectivity model for the three focal species.\nEach year, SAB conducts ongoing monitoring of beaver dams, their caches, assessments of the impacts of old beaver dams, and management to minimize their effects on salmon habitat and in-stream movement. Additionally, the SAB team assigns a priority risk level to each new beaver dam in three stages: high, medium, and low. The priority risk is mostly determined by the dam’s location relative to high-value spawning habitat, which includes both the proximity to critical spawning areas and the accessibility of spawning grounds. Beaver dams that impede access to or are located near vital spawning habitats are given higher priority for management and mitigation efforts.\n\n\n\n\nAmiro, P. 1993.

For each KEA, an associated indicator was assigned to measure the status of that KEA.

The habitat model identifies waterbodies that have a higher potential to support key habitat based on stream characteristics like channel gradient and discharge. The habitat mode criteria used were channel gradients &lt;3% for Atlantic Salmon, channel gradients &lt;5% for Rainbow Smelt, and streams with Strahler order of 2 or higher for American Eel.\nConnectivity model: A layer of known or modelled structures was overlaid on the key habitat results. Structures with unknown passability were treated as a full barrier until confirmed passable (100% passable) or partially passable (25, 50, or 75%) by either local knowledge, desktop review, or field assessment. Watershed connectivity was estimated by calculating the amount of key habitat that is connected to the ocean (i.e., not fragmented by human-made barriers). The amount of key habitat considered connected was determined by the cumulative passability of all downstream barriers. Key habitat with only passable structures downstream was considered fully connected. All key habitat with any full barrier downstream was considered disconnected. Connected key habitat upstream of partial barriers was weighted based on the passability values of any downstream partial barriers. For example, a 10 km habitat patch with two downstream partial barriers (both with 50% passability) was considered to represent 2.5 km of connected key habitat. All connected habitats were summed and divided by the total amount of key habitat in the watershed to determine the proportion of connected habitat relative to the entire watershed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Partially disconnected (orange), fully disconnected (red), and connected (light blue) key habitat for Atlantic Salmon across the seven northeastern PEI watersheds.

    "text": "Structure Prioritization Summary\nA primary outcome of the WCRP is addressing barriers (i.e., removing or replacing the barrier, or temporarily adding a fish passage structure) to restore connectivity within the seven watersheds. To achieve the goals in this plan (Table 1), it is necessary to identify a suite of barriers that, if addressed, will provide the largest, most important contribution towards restored connectivity of salmon and eel habitat. The following section outlines the ranking process to identify the list of barriers.\nAfter all existing data and knowledge are collated for known and modelled crossings, an iterative ranking process is conducted to help confirm barriers to target for rehabilitation to meet the goals. The ranking process is primarily used to guide field assessments and maximize efficiency in ground truthing data/knowledge inputs and model outputs, while providing a secondary purpose to evaluate the relative key habitat gains of confirmed barriers in the watershed. This process, combined with input from local knowledge holders and experts, is used to develop field plans for assessing structures that have the potential to block the most key habitat in the watershed.\nField assessments can include an assessment of either the passability status of a structure (whether fish can pass upstream, and to what degree), whether the upstream habitat is suitable for the focal species, and whether there are other undocumented human-made or natural barriers upstream or downstream.\nThe ranking process accounts for long-term and immediate potential habitat gains offered by each structure to improve key habitat connectivity in the watershed. All structures in the watershed (excluding those confirmed as passage) were ranked and a subset of those structures were selected by the planning team to assess during the 2024 field season. Details of the ranking process used to guide field assessments can be found in (Appendix C) .",

    "text": "Annual Progress Report\nCWF and SAB hosted an annual partner workshop in February 2023. During this workshop, project partners discussed and mapped multiple strategies to address four major threats to connectivity in the seven watersheds (barrier beaches, beaver activity, blowdowns and blockages, and stream crossings). These strategies were mapped using methods from the Conservation Standards and are outlined in the Action Plan (Table 2/Figure 1). The goal for this exercise was to creatively brainstorm several strategies, while recognizing that not all will be achieved over the course of this project. An annual work plan was created to outline which subset of tasks would be carried out from March 2023 to March 2024 (Table 1). The work plan encompasses both assessments on unassessed structures or assessed structures that remain data deficient, actions to close knowledge gaps, and activities that advance actionable confirmed barriers.\nIn summer 2023, CWF, SAB, and ASF assessed 16 structures to determine their passability status for the three focal species. Informal assessments were completed at 10 sites and full barrier assessments were completed for six of them using the Nova Scotia Salmon Association’s Adopt-A-Stream protocol (Culvert Assessment for Fish Passage | NSSA Adopt A Stream). Field assessment results were reviewed by CWF, SAB, and ASF and updates were made to the connectivity models accordingly.\nIn addition to field assessments, two projects were completed in March 2023-2024:",

    "text": "Defining Sets\nAfter all existing data and knowledge are collated for known and modelled crossings, an iterative ranking process is conducted to help confirm barriers to target for rehabilitation to meet the goals. The ranking process is primarily used to guide field assessments and maximize efficiency in ground truthing data/knowledge inputs and model outputs, while providing a secondary purpose to evaluate the relative key habitat gains of confirmed barriers in the watershed. Field assessments can include an assessment of either the passability status of a structure (whether fish can pass upstream, and to what degree), whether the upstream habitat is suitable for the focal species, and whether there are other undocumented human-made or natural barriers upstream or downstream. First, structures are grouped into ‘sets’. Sets are identified by maximizing the key habitat gain for barriers in the same tributary system. If adding a structure to a set reduces the gain-per-barrier (i.e., the total habitat gain of the set divided by the number of barriers in the set), then it is excluded and will be considered part of another set. This results in sets ranging from one to five structures. Then, each set is ranked by its potential to contribute to restoring the overall habitat connectivity. The higher a set is ranked, the more potential contribution it makes to restoring the overall habitat connectivity, therefore making the set a higher priority for field assessment. By assessing the passability status and upstream habitat of the top-ranked sets, we close knowledge gaps with the greatest influence on the overall connectivity model results.\nSets are ranked by a combination of two factors:\nAn overall ranking for each set was produced as a composite of the long-term and immediate potential gain ranks to prioritize sets that maximize long-term and immediate potential to improve key habitat connectivity in the watershed. All structures in the watershed (excluding those confirmed as passable) were ranked and a subset of those structures were selected by the planning team to assess in the 2023 field season.\nEach structure has a “gain per structure” value associated with it, which is a measure of the linear length of key habitat upstream until the next structure. Grouping structures into sets starts by taking the most downstream structure (e.g., structure A) in the stream and the next structure immediately upstream of it (e.g., structure B) and calculates the average gain per structure in that set (structure A+B/2). This process is repeated with sets increasing from two structures to five structures (e.g., structure A+B+C+D+E/5). The set with the highest average gain per structure is grouped together. Structures are left as individuals if adding a second structure reduces the average gain per structure (e.g., structure A &gt; structure A+B/2). After this set is grouped, the algorithm moves to the next structure upstream of the set and repeats the process iteratively until all structures in the stream are in a set and the entire process repeats for each stream in the network.",

This was measured by calculating the amount of functional upstream habitat (i.e., key habitat between that set and the next upstream set of structures). Sets were then ranked by functional upstream habitat amount in tiers, where sets with no downstream sets were ranked first, then sets with one downstream set, and so on.

After they are grouped together, the average length of habitat gain (kms) per barrier removal is calculated.\n\n\nRanked Structure List\nA ranked structure list orders structures by amount of habitat blocked, and where removal of an individual structure or a group of structures (a “set”) is more effective in opening up habitat.\n\n\n\nA ranked structure list helps determine where structures are blocking large amounts of habitat, and where removal of an individual structure or a group of structures (a “set”) is more effective in opening up habitat, by ranking structures based on amount of habitat blocked. This list communicates to biologists and partners which barriers are the most effective to address in terms of increasing accessible habitat — useful for biologist field work planning — and to compare with a partner’s own understanding own priorities when determining the most important barriers for remediation. This considers a combination of immediate and long-term habitat gains for removal.\nDuring a FishPass model re-run, the script rank_barriers.py ranks barriers in a watershed for a given species in order of which barriers or barrier sets, when removed, would open up the best habitat upstream based on a balance of immediate and long-term habitat gains. It should be noted that this script does not rank passable barriers or barriers which do not block any upstream habitat.\nThese sets are then ranked along the same stream whose removal as a group would open up more kms of habitat than any of those structures on their own. Those sets that would have a higher average gain per barrier removal would be ranked higher than others.\n\n\nRanking Barrier Sets\nBarrier sets are ranked based on a combination of immediate and long term habitat gains from removal.\nFirst the barrier sets are sorted by number of barriers downstream of the set then by average gain per barrier. This creates a list where sets with zero downstream barriers are ranked by average gain per barrier first, then sets with 1 downstream barrier, then 2, etc. There is a cutoff of habitat gains less than 500m. Such barrier sets are moved to the bottom of the entire list.\nThe barrier sets are given a rank according to this sorting giving a ranking based on immediate habitat gains from barrier set removal. In the final output, this is the column called rank_avg-gain_tiered.\nBarrier sets are separately ranked based on total upstream habitat from the set including all habitat blocked by other barrier sets upstream. This gives a ranking based on long term habitat gains from barrier set removal.\nThe immediate rank and the long term rank is then added together and the list of barrier sets is sorted by this value from lowest to highest. Then the barrier sets are re-ranked according to this combined value. This combined ranking favours sets with good immediate and long term habitat gains.\nThis combined ranking is also offered in a tiered format where barriers receive a letter grade where A is the top 10, B is 11-20, C is 21-30, and D is for all others.",
