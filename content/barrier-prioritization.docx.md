The barrier prioritization analysis ranked barriers by [...] A longer list of barriers is needed due to the inherent assumptions in the connectivity model, habitat model, and gaps in available data. Barriers that have been modelled (i.e., points where streams and road/rail networks intersect) are assumed to be barriers until field verification is undertaken and structures that have been assessed as "potential" barriers (e.g., may be passable at certain flow levels or for certain life history stages) require further investigation before a definitive remediation decision is made. Additionally, the habitat model identifies stream segments that have the potential to support spawning or rearing habitat for target species but does not attempt to quantify habitat quality or suitability (see Appendix B), which will require additional field verification once barrier assessments have completed.Data deficient structures represents structures that are a priority to evaluate further through barrier assessment and habitat confirmations because some structures will likely be passable, others will not be associated with usable habitat, and others may not be feasible to remediate because of logistic considerations (@tbl-deficient). Some barriers were moved forward to the "priority barrier list" (see @tbl-priority) and others were eliminated from consideration due to one or more of the considerations discussed above (see @tbl-remove). The priority barrier list represents structures that were confirmed to be partial or full barriers to fish passage and that block access to confirmed habitat. Barriers on the priority list were reviewed by planning team members and selected for inclusion for proactive pursual of remediation.  For more details on the barrier prioritization model, please see @Mazany-Wright2021-rz.
