# Project Overview {-} 

## Plan Purpose, Approach, and Scope {-}

The following Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) represents the culmination of a collaborative planning effort with the Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF), The Atlantic Salmon Federation (ASF), and the Souris and Area Branch of the PEI Wildlife Federation (SAB). The overall aim is to build meaningful partnerships, aid in reducing the threat of aquatic barriers to diadromous fish, and all that they represent, as well as the livelihoods that they support. This plan will identify priority actions that the SAB WCRP partners propose to undertake between 2023-2033 to preserve and restore fish connectively in the seven northeastern salmon watershed systems of North Lake Creek, Priest Pond Creek, Cross River, Hay River, Bear River, Naufrage River, and Cow River {#fig-geoscope}. This will be done through barrier rehabilitation and prevention strategies. These strategies will be shared with local First Nations, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), the PEI Government, NGOs, and local stakeholders to inform directed efforts to improve fish productivity and diversity in these watersheds. 

## Vision Statement {-}

SAB strives to address and remove human and natural barriers in our managed rivers that could impact movement and the natural life cycles of aquatic species.  SAB will work hard to attain and sustain dynamic watershed ecosystems with optimal physical, biological, and chemical conditions to support native wildlife populations and environmental network functionality so that fish populations can access the habitat that they need to survive and thrive in throughout their life cycles without barriers that could distress them.  This will allow our local waterways to be and remain beneficial and healthy for future generations. 

## Project Scope {-}

Connectivity is a critical component of freshwater ecosystems that encompasses a variety of factors related to ecosystem structure and function, such as the ability of aquatic organisms to disperse and/or migrate, the transportation of energy and matter (e.g., nutrient cycling and sediment flows), and temperature regulation {cite}Seliger2018-be. Though each of these factors are important when considering the health of a watershed, for the purposes of this WCRP the term "connectivity" is defined as the degree to which aquatic organisms can disperse and/or migrate freely through freshwater systems. Within this context, connectivity is primarily constrained by physical barriers, including anthropogenic infrastructure such as dams and stream crossings, and natural features such as waterfalls, barrier beaches, and beaver dams. This plan will focus on the direct rehabilitation and prevention of localized, physical barriers instead of the broad, land-use patterns causing chronic connectivity issues in the watershed. The planning team decided that the primary focus of this WCRP is addressing barriers to longitudinal connectivity (i.e., along the upstream-downstream plane) due to the importance of maintaining fish passage to spawning and rearing habitat in the watershed.

The geographic scope of this WCRP is seven watersheds (Bear River, Cow River, Cross River, Hay River, Naufrage River, North Lake Creek, Priest Pond Creek) in Souris, PE, ({numref}fig1). The seven watersheds have a total drainage area of 205.46 km2 ranging from 2.5 km2 in Priest Pond to ~49 km2 in North Lake Creek, spanning as far west as Selkirk and as east as North Lake and draining into the ocean. The geographic scope of this WCRP was further refined by identifying naturally accessible waterbodies, which are defined as streams, lakes, or reservoirs that target species would access in the absence of anthropogenic barriers ({numref}fig2). Naturally accessible waterbodies were spatially delineated using stream characteristics that define the upper limit of their movement based on species-specific swimming abilities ({numref}Table1). Areas of high, sustained beaver activity that has led to long-term changes in the habitat conditions were excluded due to the unfavorable conditions for barrier remediation. The spatial extent of the naturally accessible waterbodies layer was then expanded to include the furthest upstream fish observation data and/or redd surveys (for Atlantic Salmon). These maps were explored by the planning team to incorporate additional local knowledge, ensure accuracy, and finalize the criteria used to define naturally accessible waterbodies. The new geographic scope formed the foundation for all subsequent analyses and planning steps, including mapping and modelling key habitat, quantifying the current connectivity status, goal setting, and action planning {cite}Mazany-Wright2021-rz.

## Focal species {-}

Focal species represent the ecologically and culturally important species for which habitat connectivity is being directly conserved and/or restored in the watershed. The planning team selected three target species: Atlantic Salmon, Rainbow Smelt, and American Eel. The selection of these target species was driven primarily by local conservation goals.

## Structure Types {-}

The following table highlights which structure types pose the greatest threat to Atlantic Salmon, American Eel, and Rainbow Smelt in the seven Souris area watersheds. Each structure was assessed for its extent (i.e., the proportion of the focal species' habitat extent that is disconnected by all barriers of a given barrier type) and severity (i.e., the proportion of barrier occurrences that restrict passage to the focal species). Proportions were either scored as low (1-10%), medium (11-30%), high (31-70%) or very high (71-100%) ({numref}Table2). Then, the extent and severity scores were combined in a matrix to identify an overall threat rating. Ultimately, structure types that affect a lot of habitat and frequently fully or partially block fish received the highest ratings. No structures were given a rating of very high. The results of this assessment exercise were used to inform the subsequent planning steps, as well as to identify knowledge gaps where there is little spatial data to inform the assessment for a specific structure type.

### Blowdowns/Blockages {-}

In Sept 2022, Hurricane Fiona caused severe damage to forested areas, leading to a level of fallen trees that has been estimated to be as large as 8-10 years' worth of PEI’s logging sector harvests (INSERT CITE).  These blowdowns caused physical blockages in the river systems throughout all seven watersheds and required substantial removal efforts. Although these areas are not mapped spatially and incorporated into the estimated connectivity status, clearing blockages was a significant restoration (management?) effort undertaken by Souris and Area Branch for the past two years to restore connectivity in these seven watersheds.


### Barrier Beaches {-}

There are five barrier beaches at the mouth of Bear River, Cross River, Cow River, Hay River, and Priest Pond. These beaches serve as important estuary habitats where anadromous fish return to, or exit from, during a portion of their life cycle. The stability of barrier beaches, and therefore, passability for anadromous species, can depend on factors such as excessive or diminished sediment supply, rising sea levels resulting in washouts, and high rates of landward migration and/or fragmentation (INSERT CITE).  Additionally, anthropogenic modifications of these systems (e.g., rock piles and culverts/fish ladders) enable further widening and shortening of the estuary, the creation of upstream reservoirs, and homogenization of stream characteristics, making these systems more susceptible to instability and blocking fish passage. Cross River, Cow River, and Priest Pond beaches are considered passable, whereas Bear River is considered a partial barrier due to its over widening, shallow channel. At Hay River barrier beach there is a degraded culvert with a fish ladder on it, and this set of structures range from partial barrier to salmon and eel to full barrier to Rainbow Smelt. 


### Dams {-}

There are four mapped dams on naturally accessible waterbodies in the watersheds, three of which are blocking a total of 24.5 km and 40.8 km of modelled habitat for American Eel and Atlantic Salmon respectively. No Rainbow Smelt habitat is located upstream of these dams. Dams impede passage for all three focal species but have the largest impact on Rainbow Smelt due to their poor jumping abilities as smaller-bodied fish.   There are two known fish-passage structures associated with dams in the watersheds; a denil fish ladder on Larkins dam in Naufrage watershed and a natural bypass channel at Millers dam that leads to a culvert downstream. Larkins dam was identified on the priority barrier list (see Appendix B).


### Stream Crossings {-}

Road-stream crossings are the most abundant barrier type in the watershed, with 181 stream crossings located downstream of modelled key habitat for either Atlantic Salmon, American Eel, or Rainbow Smelt. Stream crossings fully or partially block 35.2 km (52% of habitat upstream of stream crossings) for Rainbow Smelt, 93.1 (33%) for salmon and 103.9 km (61%). XX% of assessed crossings have been confirmed as barriers to fish passage.
