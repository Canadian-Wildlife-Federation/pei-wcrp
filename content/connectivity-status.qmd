# Connectivity Status Assessment and Goals {-}

## Connectivity Status Assessment {-}

The planning team identified species-specific Key Ecological Attributes (KEAs) to assess the current connectivity status of the watershed for each focal species (@tbl-keas). KEAs are defined as a “key aspect of a focal species biology or ecology, that if missing or altered, would lead to the loss of that focal species over time”. For each KEA, an associated indicator was assigned to measure the status of that KEA. The connectivity status indicators were used to establish goals to improve key habitat connectivity over time and is the baseline against which progress is tracked over time.   

```{r priority, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
#| label: tbl-keas
#| tbl-cap: "The Key Ecological Attributes and associated indicators used to measure the connectivity status and compare against target goals set for each focal species.  Connectivity statuses were scored as either poor (<50%), fair (51-75%), good (76-90%), or very good (>90%)."

ft <- format_flextable(ft)

The current connectivity status was estimated using three spatial models: 

1. **Accessibility model**: Naturally accessible waterbodies are those that are considered likely accessible to focal species if no human-made barriers existed on the landscape. These were spatially delineated for each focal species using natural barriers (i.e., waterfalls, gradient barriers, or subsurface flows) that would limit upstream movement (@tbl-spn). 

2. **Habitat model**: A subset of the naturally accessible waterbody layer was defined as key habitat based on the KEA. The habitat model identifies waterbodies that have a higher potential to support key habitat based on stream characteristics like channel gradient and discharge. The habitat model criteria can be found in (@tbl-spn).  

3. **Connectivity model**: A layer of known or modelled structures was overlaid on the key habitat results. Structures with unknown passability were treated as a full barrier until confirmed passable (100% passable) or partially passable (25, 50, or 75%) by either local knowledge, desktop review, or field assessment. Watershed connectivity was estimated by calculating the amount of key habitat that is connected to the ocean (i.e., not fragmented by human-made barriers). The amount of key habitat considered connected was determined by the cumulative passability of all downstream barriers. Key habitat with only passable structures downstream was considered fully connected. All key habitat with any full barrier downstream was considered disconnected. Connected key habitat upstream of partial barriers was weighted based on the passability values of any downstream partial barriers. For example, a 10 km habitat patch with two downstream partial barriers (both with 50% passability) was considered to represent 2.5 km of connected key habitat. All connected habitats were summed and divided by the total amount of key habitat in the watershed to determine the proportion of connected habitat relative to the entire watershed.  

All three species have a connectivity status rated poor (<50%) (@tbl-keas/@fig-4/@fig-5/@fig-6). The low connectivity status for American Eel likely reflects a lack of ground truthing conservative connectivity models, rather than true connectivity, given that structures are presumed barriers until confirmed otherwise. The goal for future iterations of this plan is to close knowledge gaps in the passability status of several structures for American Eel. In the initial planning stages of the project, no specific goal was set for Rainbow smelt as the planning team did not have sufficient time or ability to quantify and interpret the connectivity status.
