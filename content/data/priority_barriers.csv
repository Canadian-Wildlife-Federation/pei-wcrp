The culvert is relatively new and in  good condition, but it is a closed bottom structure that is not embedded and there could be a  potential barrier in low flow. Recommendation: Baffles are needed throughout the culvert."

Debris from Fiona was cleared here. The culvert itself was soft on the bottom, blown out and leaking in areas near the outflow. The plunge pool was very deep and so completing full measurements in this area was challenging. "
