Barrier Beaches,,,
Strategy 1: Assess Passability Status,,,
Contract a hydrogeomorphologist to assess passability of each barrier beach,,SAB,CWF/ASF
Ongoing management of barrier beach access channels,,SAB,
Beaver Activity,,,
Strategy 1: On-going Management,,,
1a. Identify individual beaver dams that block fish passage outside of areas of high beaver activity,,SAB,
"1b. Notify DTI of areas with problematic, high beaver activity",,SAB,
Strategy 2: Develop long-term monitoring program,,,
2a. Develop long-term monitoring program (incl. more monitoring of estuaries),,SAB,
Strategy 3: Update Best Management Practices,,,
3a. Update beaver management plan (and incorporate WCRP outcomes),,SAB,CWF/SAB
Strategy 4: Invest in Training,,,
4a. Support the training and employment of beaver trappers,,DTI,PEIWA/SAB
Strategy 5: Complete Cost/Benefit Analysis,,,
"5a. Conduct analysis to determine the costs of not managing beaver activity on infrastructure, to justify the benefits of paying to manage it. Incorporate the cost/benefit of province paying for beaver pelts to support harvesting",,DTI,
Blowdowns and Blockages,,,
Strategy 1: Post-Fiona Clean Up,,,
Clear larger structures that hold back debris and sediment and block fish passage,,SAB,
Strategy 2: Conduct Experiment,,,
Conduct experiment to study effects of clearing or leaving blowdowns on fish passage and habitat conditions,,SAB,ASF/DFO/Climate Lab at UPEI
Stream crossings,,,
Strategy 1: Survey and Address Priority Barriers,,,
1a. Identify priority structures for field assessments and conduct stream crossing assessments,,CWF,"SAB, ASF"
"1b. Identify priority structures to be addressed through removal, replacement, or installing fish passage",,CWF,"SAB, ASF"
1c. Confirm availability of infrastructure resiliency funding,,SAB,DTI
Strategy 2: Develop Best Management Practices,,,
2a. Find or develop best management practices for stream crossing design relevant to PEI,,PEIWA,ASF/CWF
"2b. Advocate for BMPs with crossing designers, managers, and other key stakeholders",,PEIWA,ASF/CWF
