The following Watershed Connectivity Restoration Plan (WCRP) represents the culmination of a collaborative planning effort with the Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF), The Atlantic Salmon Federation (ASF), and the Souris and Area Branch of the PEI Wildlife Federation (SAB). The overall aim is to build meaningful partnerships, aid in reducing the threat of aquatic barriers to diadromous fish, and all that they represent, as well as the livelihoods that they support. This plan will identify priority actions that the SAB WCRP partners propose to undertake between 2023-2033 to preserve and restore fish connectivity in the seven northeastern salmon watershed systems of North Lake Creek, Priest Pond Creek, Cross River, Hay River, Bear River, Naufrage River, and Cow River. This will be done through barrier rehabilitation and prevention strategies. These strategies will be shared with local First Nations, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), the PEI Government, NGOs, and local stakeholders to inform directed efforts to improve fish productivity and diversity in these watersheds.
